  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The ReadableStream interface of the Streams API represents a readable stream of byte data. The Fetch API offers a
    concrete instance of a ReadableStream through the body property of a Response object.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    A prime use-case for ReadableStream is as the content of a Response object. This enables developers the
    construct a streaming response and serve this to the browser through a Service Worker.

  <p>
    This is the core functionality of this app.

  <p>
    ReadableStream is supported by all modern browsers.
