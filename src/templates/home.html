  <h2>An instant multi-page app</h2>

  <p>
    This is a demo of a instantly loading multi-page app, using modern web technology like Service Worker,
    ReadableStream,
    CSS Containment and Portals.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose is to demonstrate that a multi-page app can load just as fast as a single-page app, without all the
    added complexity that a single-page app brings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each request is intercepted by the Service Worker which then constructs each page from a header, footer and the
    page content. These parts are all separate HTML templates that are fetched separately and then put together to form
    a page.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make sure that content is shown to the user as soon as possible, a ReadableStream is used to stream content to
    the browser. This means that the browser doesn't need to wait for the whole response to arrive, but can start
    rendering content as soon as it becomes available.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Service Worker also caches all assets locally so these no longer need to be fetched from the network.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is that each page loads instantly, just like a single-page app, even though the browser performs a full
    page reload for each page.
  </p>

  <p>
    This effectively reduces single-page apps to a polyfill.
